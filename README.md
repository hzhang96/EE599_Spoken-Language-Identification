# EE599_Spoken-Language-Identification  
Spoken Language Identification (LID) is broadly defined as recognizing the language of a given speech utterance [1]. It has numerous applications in automated language and speech recognition, multilingual machine translations, speech-to-speech translations, and emergency call routing. In this homework, we will try to classify three languages (English, Hindi and Mandarin) from the spoken utterances that have been crowd-sourced from the class.
#### Goals:
>1. Extract Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from audio, which will be employed as features.  
>2. Implement a GRU/LSTM model, and train it to classify the languages.
